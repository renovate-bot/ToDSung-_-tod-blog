# Lessons (record of past mistakes)

Format and pruning rules are in [maintenance.md](maintenance.md) §3–§4. New entries are appended at the end of the file.

## 2026-07-11 .claude/skills are copies, not junctions
- Context: auditing the cross-agent skills-sharing mechanism.
- Mistake: both AGENTS.md and the memory file claimed `.claude/skills/` consists of NTFS junctions; measurement (`fsutil reparsepoint query` reported "not a reparse point") showed they are full directory copies instead; also, `vercel-react-best-practices` had only been deleted from the `.claude` side — `.agents/skills/` still had a leftover copy that git was still tracking.
- Fix: established `.agents/skills/` as the single source of truth + manual sync after edits + run `diff -rq .agents/skills .claude/skills` before starting work.
- Codified?: written into AGENTS.md's "Cross-agent skills" section.

## 2026-07-11 garbled git output under Chinese locale
- Context: running `git log` in a Git Bash pipeline.
- Mistake: Chinese commit messages and cmd output came out garbled (`���~ 4390`), which is easily misread as a command failure and triggers pointless retries.
- Fix: check the exit code first; use `git log --oneline` or `--format=%s` to inspect commits; avoid piping Chinese output through `cmd /c` again.
- Codified?: written into AGENTS.md's "Windows environment gotchas" section.
